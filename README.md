# golang-sdl2-scrolling
golang-sdl2-scrolling is repo that uses the SDL2 library and golang to create a scrolling background, much like you might find in a 2D video game.

There are two examples in this repository. The first is a simple scroll effect which moves an image across the screen. The second is slightly more advanced as it moves several image "layers" at different speeds to create what is known as a parallax effect.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling)

## Installation

Choose one of the examples you wish to run and cd to that directory. For example if you want to run the parallax

```
cd 2_parallax
```

The run the build command

```
go build .
```
